## Feature: MenuPopover Accessibility and User Interaction

    ### ✅ Background
 
    > The trigger element (button or any interactive component) is located outside of the MenuPopover content and supports both opening and closing the MenuPopover.   
    > The trigger uses `aria-haspopup="menu"` to indicate it controls a menu.     
    > When the MenuPopover is open, its content is rendered inside a floating layer or portal separate from the trigger.  
    > The MenuPopover uses `role="menu"` to expose its purpose to assistive technologies.  
    > menuitems inside the MenuPopover are assigned appropriate ARIA roles: `menuitem` (for standard actions), `menuitemcheckbox` (for toggleable items), or `menuitemradio` (for single-select groups).  
    > Logical groups of menuitems have accessible headings provided via visible text, semantic heading elements, or `aria-labelledby`.  
    > The MenuPopover is configured with **focus trap enabled**, ensuring keyboard focus remains inside the MenuPopover while it is open.  
    > In all scenarios below, "MenuPopover" refers to the **root-level menu** unless specifically stated otherwise for nested submenus.

    > And the menupopover should close  

    **Scenario: Disabled menuitems are non-interactive using mouse**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem is visually disabled  
    > When I click on the disabled menuitem  
    > Then the menuitem should not trigger any action  
    > And the menupopover should remain open  

    **Scenario: Disabled menuitems are non-interactive using keyboard**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem is visually disabled  
    > When I navigate using the keyboard  
    > Then keyboard navigation should skip the disabled menuitem  
    > And the menuitem should not trigger any action  
    > And the menupopover should remain open  

    ### ✅ Keyboard Navigation

    **Scenario: Navigate menuitems using Home and End keys**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And focus is on a menuitem  
    > When I press the "Home" key

    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And focus is on the first menuitem  
    > When I press the "ArrowUp" key  
    > Then focus should move to the last menuitem   

    ### ✅ Nested Submenus (or nested menupopover)

    **Scenario: Open nested submenu with mouse**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem contains a nested submenu  
    > When I click on that menuitem  
    > Then a nested submenu should appear adjacent to the parent menuitem  
    > And it should open on the correct side (right in LTR, left in RTL)  

    **Scenario: Open nested submenu using keyboard**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem contains a nested submenu  
    > When I focus the menuitem and press the appropriate open key:  
    > - "Right Arrow" in LTR

    **Scenario: Selecting a nested menuitem (mouse or keyboard)**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a submenu inside it is open and visible  
    > And (if using keyboard) focus is on a nested menuitem inside that submenu  
    > When I select the nested menuitem (by clicking it, or pressing "Enter" or "Space")  
    > Then the action associated with that nested item should be executed  
    > And the nested submenu should close  
    > And all parent menupopovers (including the root menupopover) should close  

    ### ✅ Separator and Group Handling

    **Scenario: Skipping separator during navigation**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And it includes visual separators between menuitems  
    > When I navigate with arrow keys  
    > Then focus should skip over the separator and move to the next focusable menuitem  

    **Scenario: Grouped menuitems have headings**
    > Given the menupopover includes logical groups of menuitems  
    > Then each group should be introduced with a visible or screen-reader accessible heading  
    > And focus should move between menuitems normally across groups  

    ### ✅ Menuitem Types

    **Scenario: Toggle menuitemcheckbox using mouse**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem with role `menuitemcheckbox` is present  
    > When I click on the menuitem  
    > Then its checked state should toggle between true and false  
    > And the visual indicator should reflect the current state  
    > And the menupopover should remain open  

    **Scenario: Toggle menuitemcheckbox using keyboard**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a menuitem with role `menuitemcheckbox` is present and focused  
    > When I press the "Enter" or "Space" key

    > And the visual indicator should reflect the current state   
    > And the menupopover should remain open  

    **Scenario: Select one menuitemradio from a group using mouse**  
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And a group of menuitems with role `menuitemradio` is present  
    > When I click on one of the radio items  
    > Then that menuitem should be selected  
    > And all other items in the same group should be deselected  
    > And the menupopover should remain open  

    **Scenario: Select one menuitemradio from a group using keyboard**  
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > And focus is on a menuitem with role `menuitemradio` in a group  
    > When I press the "Enter" or "Space" key  
    > Then that menuitem should be selected  
    > And all other items in the group should be deselected  
    > And the menupopover should remain open  
 

    ### ✅ Focus Behavior

    **Scenario: Focus moves to first menuitem on open**
    > Given the menupopover is closed  
    > When I open it using keyboard  
    > Then focus should move to the first focusable menuitem inside the menupopover  

    **Scenario: Focus returns to trigger on close**
    > Given the menupopover was opened using keyboard  
    > When I close it using keyboard  
    > Then focus should return back to the element that opened the menupopover (the trigger element)  

    **Scenario: Escape key closes nested submenus step-by-step**
    > Given I have navigated into a nested submenu  
    > When I press the "Escape" key  
    > Then only the currently open submenu should close  
    > And focus should return back to the parent menuitem  
    > And pressing Escape again should continue closing menupopovers upward  

    ### ✅ Accessibility

    **Scenario: ARIA roles and attributes are correctly applied**
    > Given the menupopover is rendered on the page  
    > Then the trigger element has `aria-haspopup="menu"` and the menupopover container has `role="menu"`  
    > And each menuitem has the appropriate role: `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, or `menuitemradio`  
    > And grouped menu sections have accessible headings using visible text, `aria-label`, or semantic heading elements

    **Scenario: Menu container is announced when navigating into menupopover**
    > Given the menupopover is open  
    > When I navigate into it using screen reader  
    > Then the screen reader announces the menu region with role `menu`  
    > And announces the menu's accessible name if provided via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`

    **Scenario: menuitems are announced with labels and roles**
    > Given I navigate to a menuitem using screen reader  
    > Then the screen reader announces the menuitem's label text  
    > And announces its role (e.g. "menuitem")

    **Scenario: Submenuitems are announced as expandable**
    > Given I navigate to a menuitem that has a submenu  
    > Then the screen reader announces the menuitem's label  
    > And announces its expanded or collapsed state if applicable

    **Scenario: Checkbox and radio state is announced**
    > Given I navigate to a `menuitemcheckbox` or `menuitemradio`  
    > Then the screen reader announces the menuitem's label  
    > And announces whether it is checked/unchecked (for checkbox) or selected (for radio)

    **Scenario: Separators are skipped by the screen reader**
    > Given the menupopover contains section dividers (separators)  
    > When I navigate using screen reader   
    > Then the screen reader skips directly to the next content menuitem afterwards

    **Scenario: Group headings are announced for context**
    > Given the menupopover contains groups of menuitems with headings  
    > When I navigate into a group using screen reader   
    > Then the screen reader announces the group heading label  
    > And as I navigate through the group, each menuitem’s label and role are announced individually
